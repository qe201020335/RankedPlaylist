# RankedPlaylist
Beat Saber ranked playlist generator.

## PC MOD
This is for the **PC** version of Beat Saber (Steam/Oculus). If you are playing the quest version, please see the [Standalone Version](#standalone-version) below.

### Mod Requirements
These can be downloaded from [BeatMods](https://beatmods.com/#/mods) or using [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant/releases/latest).

Alternatively, you can also download them from their github repo.
* [BSIPA](https://github.com/bsmg/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded)
* [BSML](https://github.com/monkeymanboy/BeatSaberMarkupLanguage)
* [PlaylistManager](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager)
* [BeatSaberPlaylistsLib](https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberPlaylistsLib) (Included by PlaylistManager)

Technically this mod doesn't depend on PlaylistManager, but without it you won't be able to see the playlist and download the songs.

### HOW TO USE
1. Make sure all the required mods are working correctly
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/qe201020335/RankedPlaylist/releases/latest) (NOT the standalone version) and extract the archive into Beat Saber game directory.
3. Run the game and you will see the button ***Ranked Playlist***.
4. After genearting a playlist, you can download the songs using [PlaylistManager](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager).

## Standalone Version
Use this if you are playing the quest version of Beat Saber!

1. Download the **standalone** one from the [latest release](https://github.com/qe201020335/RankedPlaylist/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive and run `RankedPlaylistGenerator.exe`.
3. Follow the options and you will have a `bplist` file!
4. Drag the generated playlist into the upload page of your BMBF.

Currently this only works on Windows. I'm thinking about making a web version of this generator so you can use it anywhere.
